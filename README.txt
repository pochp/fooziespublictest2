[1. Button Settings]
There's no longer a button config required!
In the main menu and character select screen, press F4 to assign devices.
Press a valid button on a device to set it as P1 (left side), then do the same for P2 (right side).

Button Layout is:
A : Square
B : Triangle
C : Circle or R1
Joystick : move left or right (hold away from the opponent to block). You can crouch to block without moving and block low attacks.


[2. Menus]
-Main Menu :
either player presses A to go to character select screen

-Character Select Screen :
each player can move left or right to select a character.
confirm selection with A
cancel selection with B
pressing B will return to main menu if you have not selected anything yet
the score displayed in this screen is the number of wins
when both players have selected a character, the match will begin


[3. Gameplay]
A - attack. startup : 6. active : 4. recovery : 45. blockstun : 43. static difference : -5
B - throw. startup : 3. active : 2. recovery : 30. tech window : 3.
C - super. costs 50% gauge. You get gauge when you block. skill depends on the character.
Dash - Moves you forward during 15 frames, then 10 frames of recovery. Can be cancelled into attack or throw, not block.
Sweep - startup : 12. active : 3. recovery : 60. blockstun : 43. static difference : -16

Attacks have pushback on block.
First to 5 points wins.
Timeout and trades give a point to both players, unless one player would win from this point. It's the closest thing to a comeback mechanic, by giving the losing player an advantage to drawing things out.

[4. Known Bugs]
-hitbox controllers tend to glitch out when switching between forward and backward (might be fixed with switch to Rewired)
-punishing sweep on block displays "Whiff Punish" instead of "Punish"

-well there's also a big to-do list. please look forward to it.
